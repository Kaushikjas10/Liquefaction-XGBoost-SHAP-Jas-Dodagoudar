# Liquefaction-XGBoost-SHAP-Jas-Dodagoudar
This repository is associated with interpretable liquefaction potential assessment model. This model is developed by using XGBoost and SHAP. 
The CPT database used to developed the model was CPT. This CPT database is collected from Boulanger and Idriss (2014, 2016).

This repository contains these files: processed dataset, Model D, SHAP explainer, and a few developed codes.
This repository is part of the below project. If you use this in your work, dont forget to cite as below:

In case any queries about this work, feel free to contact with this email id: ce19d202@smail.iitm.ac.in.

The codes and model files will be uploaded soon.
